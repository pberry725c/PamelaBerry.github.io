													<h3>Brand Statement</h3>

												of experience at an industry-leading company. While my previous role was primarily hands-on, I have cultivated a passion

													<h3>What has brought me here?</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Some areas of life can be inaccessible to you if you're never introduced to them. It's not the fault of anyone or any one thing necessarily, just that there are more facets to life than what one could reasonably come across during their given time. However, once those facets are available to you, they could change how you approach the things that matter. For me, I was introduced to a career in data analytics through TikTok of all places. But, regardless of how the idea entered my life, I've started down this path intrepidly. </p>
												<p>I started out exploring the lives of those I encountered who thrived in data analytics as a career. As I was at the time in a very hands-on, physically involved role, I was a bit weary at first as I enjoyed the way in which my mind could engage with what I was doing. But those who influenced me to look into the career convinced me that it can be suited to any who found the exhilaration in looking deeper into the information before them. And that was the very thing that I enjoyed about my position – there were always new ways to engage with the elements that could fluctuate and adjust slightly which meant there was always room for optimization and opportunities for further efficiency. </p>
												<p>Once I began learning programs like SQL online, I knew I wanted to continue learning, but also that I would need some help. Finding somewhere that I could learn all the programs involved with data analytics and be afforded the opportunity to ask specific questions as I encountered them led me to the Data Analytics Bootcamp at General Assembly. The program was intensive and informative. I had several moments when I thought I wouldn’t reach the end of it, but I persevered with a tenacity that gained the respect of my instructors.  Now, I’m excited to engage with data for a company that wants to pursue optimization and efficiency with an outreach aimed at helping those around them. </p>
